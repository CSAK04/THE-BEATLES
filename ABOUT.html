           <P>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up
             comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are
             regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the 
             development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.
             Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporatedelements of
             classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music 
             styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers 
             in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many 
             aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth 
             and sociocultural movements    
            </P>
            
            <p>Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's
             previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool
             and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. 
             The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a 
             succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. 
             Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin 
             guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after 
             their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense 
             fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four", with 
             Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal 
             title of "fifth Beatle".
